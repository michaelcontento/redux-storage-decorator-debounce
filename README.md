Debounce decorator for [redux-storage][] to delay & combine the expensive
`engine.save` operation.

# Moved to the react-stack organisation

My focus has left the node / react ecosystem and this module has got a new home
over at [react-stack](https://github.com/react-stack/redux-storage-decorator-debounce)!

## Installation

    npm install --save redux-storage-decorator-debounce

## Usage

This decorator will delay the expensive save operation for the given ms. Every
new change to the state tree will reset the timeout!

```js
import debounce from 'redux-storage-decorator-debounce'

engine = debounce(engine, 1500);
```
